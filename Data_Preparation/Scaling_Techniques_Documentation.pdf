In this project, we applied feature scaling to the numerical features using the StandardScaler from Scikit-learn.This technique standardizes the features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance.
code Snippets: from sklearn preprocessing import
StandardScaler
#Feature scaling scaler = StandardScaler() numerical_features = ['tenure','MonthlyCharges']
df_encoded[numerical_features] = scaler.fit_transform(df_encoded[numerical_features])
